# Bun's Tutorial Repository

Just whipped up this new repo to organize tutorial source code all in one place. I'll slowly be adding them as they get published or refactored.

## Issue Reporting

Please report any issues you find. And remember, you can always find me on Twitch
3x a week for questions if you have any.

## Live Coding on Twitch

**If you have any questions** about this article, the code, or just wanna hang out with fellow nerds - swing by during a live stream and say hello! I stream Python shenanigans & _lame jokesâ„¢_ every Tuesday, Thursday, & Saturday at 7pm PST.
